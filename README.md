Welcome to my shell script learning repository! This repository contains various shell scripts that I have created while learning shell scripting.

## What is shell scripting?

Shell scripting is the process of creating and executing a script file containing a series of commands in a shell. A shell is a command-line interface that allows you to interact with your operating system.

## Getting Started

To run the scripts in this repository, you'll need to have a Unix-based system with a shell installed. If you're on a Mac or Linux machine, you should already have a shell installed. If you're on a Windows machine, you can use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to run shell scripts.

To run a script, navigate to the directory where the script is located and type the following command:

```
./scriptname.sh
```
